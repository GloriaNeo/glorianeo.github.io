I'm Gloria Neo, aspiring data scientist and former architectural designer. While my career shift may surprise some, my architectural background has instilled in me attention to detail, a balance of functionality and finesse, efficient teamwork, and problem-solving centered on user needs. These skills, honed in architecture, are now my assets in data science, where my distinctive background and insatiable curiosity offer a unique perspective to my team.

## My Design Background

Before transitioning to data science, I immersed myself in various architectural projects across small and international firms, even stepping into roles with a main contractor. Notably, I led the design and construction of a 28,000sqm tertiary institution in Cambodia, where I seamlessly navigated technical challenges to craft creative, user-centric solutions. During my time in the Architectural, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) Industry, I was an advocate of streamlining Building Information Modelling (BIM) workflows and actively promoted a culture of learning through company-wide training initiatives.

## Data Science

My journey into data science followed my exposure to the data world through BIM. Enrolling in General Assembly's Data Science Immersive bootcamp marked my decisive leap into this captivating field. Data science is a harmonious blend of the rational and creative, where numbers, formulas, algorithms, and visualizations converge into a dynamic, ever-evolving landscape. Every project brings new learning opportunities, ideal for someone like me who thrives on continuous growth.

Above all, I'm passionate about leveraging data for good. I firmly believe in the transformative power of data to revolutionize the world, driving innovation, and creating positive impacts. As we witness the incredible value it brings to countless people, I'm thrilled to be on the forefront of this data-driven revolution.
